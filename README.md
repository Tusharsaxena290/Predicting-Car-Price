# RealLifeProblem-PredictingCar-sPrice
Here, we dealt with the real life problem predicting the price of a car. 
For knowning the features used, you can refer to the dataset or to know the cleaned or preprocessed features, refer to jupyter file.

Here before performing regression, we dealt with data cleaning(pre processing), outliers, checking the OLS assumptions, creating dummy variables and the dummy trap that might lead to multicoliinearity.

Just before performing the regression we scaled the data and split the model into test and train submodels.
